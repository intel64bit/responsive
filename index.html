                One of the most important polka groups of the 2010's, Raintree Rose formed as a trio of high school friends and ended up becoming a gargantuan influence on the early 2000s American polka scene. With swinging tempos and cacaphonous accordions, their best singles are virtually unrivaled.

                    <p>
                            Did the greatest Pop star of all time write the music for one of the most successful video game franchises of all time? It turns out that he did! Michael Jackson was the magnificent mind behind the music for the iconic 1993 console game Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Now that you consider Michael Jacksons quirky nature, it doesn't seem all that out there to consider the fact he created one of the most infectiously catchy theme tunes of all time!
